# crossword.js - Javascript module to visualize crosswords. 

A complete - from scratch - rewrite of the Jweisbeck Crossword https://github.com/jweisbeck/Crossword 

**status**

- Visualization part done
- Checking parts needs to be implemented
- some UX features are still missing: default to overwrite on inputs

**features**
- show crossword
- show clues / questions
- interactively solve crossword


**todos**

- ~~lists need data enumeration~~
- ~~inputs need data enumeration~~
- ~~start fields need enumeration~~
- ~~override input~~
- ~~arrow key should allow for navigation~~

- crossword needs a check function
    - !define if checker is needed when creating crossword! (good when later on handling cw data and checking from server backend)
        - check letter 
        - check word
        - check crossword

- storage and acces of current cw state
    - make it easy to pass information to server backend for checking
